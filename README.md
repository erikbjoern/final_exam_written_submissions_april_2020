Please explain the steps you think are necessary to perform to get a feature done, from an idea to an implemented solution that is running in production. Be as detailed as possible.

### Answer:

* Capture requirements - what are we going to build, for whom, what's the purpose?
* Design sprint - to brainstorm what features will be included, usecases for the application and so on. Estimate scale of the application, which might impact choice of technologies. Choose stack/frameworks to do the implementation within.
* Formulate requirements and features in User Stories, with clear statements of what - for whom - why. Add acceptance criteria to stories - what's the definition of done?

* Use CI and CD
